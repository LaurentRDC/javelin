--
-- This module contains data structures and functions to work with `Series` capable of holding unboxed values,
-- i.e. values of types which are instances of `Unbox`.
--
-- = Why use unboxed series?
--
-- Unboxed series can have much better performance, at the cost of less flexibility. For example,
-- an unboxed series cannot contain values of type @`Maybe` a@. Moreover, unboxed series aren't instances of 
-- `Functor` or `Foldable`.
--
-- If you are hesitating, you should prefer the series implementation in the "Data.Series" module.
--
-- = Introduction to series
--
-- A `Series` of type @Series k a@ is a labeled array of values of type @a@,
-- indexed by keys of type @k@.
--
-- Like `Data.Map.Strict.Map` from the @containers@ package, `Series` support efficient:
--
--      * random access by key ( \(O(\log n)\) );
--      * slice by key ( \(O(\log n)\) ).
--
-- Like `Data.Vector.Vector`, they support efficient:
--
--      * random access by index ( \(O(1)\) );
--      * slice by index ( \(O(1)\) );
--      * numerical operations.
--
-- This module re-exports most of the content of "Data.Series.Generic", with type signatures 
-- specialized to the boxed container type `Data.Vector.Vector`.
--
-- For better performance (at the cost of more constraints), especially when it comes to numerical calculations, prefer to
-- use "Data.Series.Unboxed", which contains an implementation of series specialized to the unboxed container type `Data.Vector.Unboxed.Vector`.
