-- This module contains data structures and functions to work with 'Series' capable of holding any Haskell value.

--
-- = Introduction to series
--
-- A 'Series' of type @Series k a@ is a labeled array of values of type @a@,
-- indexed by keys of type @k@.
--
-- Like `Data.Map.Strict.Map` from the @containers@ package, 'Series' support efficient:
--
--      * random access by key ( \(O(\log n)\) );
--      * slice by key ( \(O(\log n)\) ).
--
-- Like `Data.Vector.Vector`, they support efficient:
--
--      * random access by index ( \(O(1)\) );
--      * slice by index ( \(O(1)\) );
--      * numerical operations.
--
-- This module re-exports most of the content of "Data.Series.Generic", with type signatures 
-- specialized to the boxed container type `Data.Vector.Vector`.
--
-- For better performance (at the cost of more constraints), especially when it comes to numerical calculations, prefer to
-- use "Data.Series.Unboxed", which contains an implementation of series specialized to the unboxed container type `Data.Vector.Unboxed.Vector`.

-- | Select a subseries. There are a few ways to do this.

-- The first way to do this is to select a sub-series based on random keys. For example,

--

-- >>> xs `select` Index.fromList ['a', 'd']

-- >>> xs `select` 'b' `to` 'c'
-- index | values
-- ----- | ------
--   'b' |     20
--   'c' |     30
--
-- Note that with `select`, you'll always get a sub-series; if you ask for a key which is not
-- in the series, it'll be ignored:
--
-- >>> xs `select` Index.fromList ['a', 'd', 'e']
-- index | values
-- ----- | ------
--   'a' |     10
--   'd' |     40
--
