--
-- = Introduction to series
--
-- A `Series` of type @Series k a@ is a labeled array of values of type @a@,
-- indexed by keys of type @k@.
--
-- Like `Data.Map.Strict.Map` from the @containers@ package, `Series` support efficient:
--
--      * random access by key ( \(O(\log n)\) );
--      * slice by key ( \(O(\log n)\) ).
--
-- Like `Data.Vector.Vector`, they support efficient:
--
--      * random access by index ( \(O(1)\) );
--      * slice by index ( \(O(1)\) );
--      * numerical operations.
--
-- This module re-exports most of the content of "Data.Series.Generic", with type signatures 
-- specialized to the boxed container type `Data.Vector.Vector`.
--
-- For better performance (at the cost of more constraints), especially when it comes to numerical calculations, prefer to
-- use "Data.Series.Unboxed", which contains an implementation of series specialized to the unboxed container type `Data.Vector.Unboxed.Vector`.
