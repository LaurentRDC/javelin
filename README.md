# Haskell implementation of data structures for data science

Packages in this repository implement series and dataframes, data structures which are ubiquitous in data science.

## Tutorial and documentation

Tutorials and interface documentation are available for the most recent published version of:

* [javelin (implementation of series)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/javelin).
* [javelin-frames (implementation of dataframes)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/javelin-frames)

Locally, you can generate documentation for all packages using `haddock` like so:

```bash
cabal haddock javelin
cabal haddock javelin-io
cabal haddock javelin-frames
```
